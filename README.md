# knowmusic_phpangular
A website that introduces the essential songs for each genre, to give people a kickstart when getting in to a new one. Uses the Spotify API, and I plan to utilise PHP with Angular here (would use node.js but the hosting company doesn't support it).

# Note
All the main functionality of this website is in place. I would like to add a few extras (like sub-genres) and just pretty up the website in general, but those are post v1.0 things, so no need to worry right now.

Check out a live version of the site, at http://www.benjamescook.com/knowmusic/

# Todo List
- [x] Implement AngularJS for handling Spotify API returns
- [x] Put the playlist names + images + ids (maybe some meta info? The pages feel a bit bare right now) in a database and have index pull from that
- [x] Improve visuals to look more attractive
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Fix up mobile visuals
- [x] Split Angular in to separate files
- [x] Minify code
- [ ] Documentation (As in, just comment it. I'm not writing up a whole bunch of booklets on how to use something this simple.)
