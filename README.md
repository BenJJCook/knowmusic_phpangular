# knowmusic_phpangular
A website that introduces the essential songs for each genre, to give people a kickstart when getting in to a new one. Uses the Spotify API, and I plan to utilise PHP with Angular here (would use node.js but the hosting company doesn't support it).

# Note
This project is highly undeveloped, right now. I plan to implement AngularJS in to this later, and store the genre names and Spotify IDs in a MySQL database. Right now, the PHP writes some JSON directly in to the
JS, which is absolutely hideous, but it's just a temporary measure to check if the Spotify API is working.

Check out a live version of the site, at http://www.benjamescook.com/knowmusic/

# Todo List
- [ ] Fix up mobile visuals
- [ ] Implement AngularJS for handling Spotify API returns
- [ ] Put the playlist names + images + ids (maybe some meta info? The pages feel a bit bare right now) in a database and have index pull from that
- [ ] Improve visuals to look more attractive
- [ ] Minify code
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Some other stuff I'll remember later
