# knowmusic_phpangular
A website that introduces the essential songs for each genre, to give people a kickstart when getting in to a new one. Uses the Spotify API, and I plan to utilise PHP with Angular here (would use node.js but the hosting company doesn't support it).

# Note
The core of this project is mostly done. I just want to pretty it up before I consider it version 1.0. Also, there's hardly any error handling, so I need to put in some Tech Diff screens, and redirects.

Check out a live version of the site, at http://www.benjamescook.com/knowmusic/

# Todo List
- [x] Implement AngularJS for handling Spotify API returns
- [x] Put the playlist names + images + ids (maybe some meta info? The pages feel a bit bare right now) in a database and have index pull from that
- [ ] Improve visuals to look more attractive
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Fix up mobile visuals
- [ ] Split Angular in to separate files
- [ ] Minify code
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Some other stuff I'll remember later
